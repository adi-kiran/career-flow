## IMPROVEMENTS

When our team took over the project from the previous group, we thoroughly reviewed the project in order to establish an effective takeover strategy. We attempted to improve the project in as many ways as possible. We've detailed the enhancements we've made in this document.

* Easier environment setuup with docker
The previous instructions were cumbersome and unnecessarily manual. In Phase 2, we have provided dockerized setup where the whole application is spawned up with a single docker command. Multiple profiles are provided in docker compose to make local development easier.

* Introducing resume builder feature:
Have introduced a new feature where the user will be able to build/create a resume within the application.

* Added new notification feature
Added new feature to notifiy users of various actions and remind them of upcoming deadlines.

* Adding Software documentation:
Provided eloborate software documentation with all the changes done.

* Restructuring the Flask application:
We have made the application more readable and maintenable by modularizing code.
