# Technical Overview

This application is a React-based web application that runs in the user's web browser. It provides the following key features:

- **User Authentication**: Upon logging in, the application creates and stores tokens locally on the user's machine to maintain user sessions securely.

- **Access Control**: Authenticated users have access to multiple pages and features within the application, ensuring a personalized and controlled user experience.

- **Backend Server**: The application relies on a Flask server to serve various user requests. The server interacts with a MongoDB database to fetch and store data as needed, ensuring smooth functionality and data persistence.

With these components working together, the application delivers a secure and feature-rich experience to its users.
